  <p>I am a Ph.D candidate in the <a href="http://www.geog.umd.edu/">Geographical Sciences Department at the University of Maryland, College Park</a>, with an M.A. in Conservation Biology and Sustainable Development. I specialize in using machine learning and Bayesian statistical models to predict how wildlife populations and habitats will be affected by environmental changes. My research involves using GIS, remotely sensed data, spatial statistics, and programming tools such as R to analyze big wildlife survey data. I am particularly interested in avian distribution and long term avian population changes in the U.S. I am advised by Dr. Ralph Dubayah.
