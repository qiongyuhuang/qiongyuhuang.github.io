 I am a Ph.D candidate in the Geographical Sciences Department at the University of Maryland, College Park. I have a masters degree in Conservation Biology and Sustainable Development. I am specialized in using machine learning and Bayesian statistical models to predict  wildlife populations and  habitat affected by environmental changes. My researches involve using GIS, remotely sensed data, spatial statistics as well as programming tool such as R to analyze big wildlife survey data. I am particularly interested in avian distribution and long term avian population changes in the U.S. Currently I am focusing on teaching and research advised by Dr. Ralph Dubayah.
